--

The Platform provides many features to help you generate the response HTML for your request handler. Note that the use of templates is built into the [node:dev/plugin/interface/exchange] object passed into your [node:dev/plugin/request-handling:request handler], and you only need to use the @template()@ function if you're doing something special.


h2. Interface

h3(function). template(templateName)

Retrieve one of the plugin's template objects.

For request handling, it's often not necessary to use this directly, but it's useful for rendering things as HTML in other parts of the plugin.

It can also be used to retrieve a standard template, the names of which all begin @std:@.


h3(function). registerHandlebarsHelper(name, helperFunction)

Register a Handlebars helper function, making it available to all the templates rendered by this plugin.


h3(property). staticDirectoryUrl

The public facing path to the @static@ directory, used for referring to the static resources.

The path returned does *not* contain a trailing @/@.


h3(function). rewriteCSS(css)

Given a string containing some CSS, rewrite it to reflect the current installation. Replacements made are:

|*String*|*Replaced with*|
|@PLUGIN_STATIC_PATH@|Public path of the static files, as @staticDirectoryUrl@|


h3(function). form(specification)

Declare a form for use by this plugin.

Returns a [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-description] object.

@form()@ can only be called while the plugin is being loaded.


h3(function). dataSource(name, kind, definition)

Define a data source. See [node:dev/plugin/form/data-source] for the various ways data sources can be defined.

@dataSource()@ can only be called while the plugin is being loaded.
