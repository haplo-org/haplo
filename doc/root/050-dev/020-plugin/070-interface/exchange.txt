A JavaScript object implementing the @Exchange@ interface represents an HTTP request / response exchange.


h2. Construction

Constructed by the Platform when a plugin handles a request, and is passed in as the first argument to the handler function.


h2. Interface

h3(property). request

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/request] object for this HTTP exchange.


h3(property). response

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/response] object for this HTTP exchange.


h3(function). render(view, templateName, templateOptions)

This function generates an HTTP response body by rendering a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template]. The MIME type is set automatically from the @kind@ property of the template.

If the template is HTML, the response will include the standard 'chrome' (header, footer, menus, navigation, etc) with the rendered template as the content of the page.

The @templateName@ argument is optional. If it's not specified or is @null@, then an implied name will be used. This is the last path element in the path passed to the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin]'s @respond()@ function.

Note you can use a standard template as well as your plugin's templates. This is often useful when doing common actions, for example, presenting a template object for the user to fill in and save with the [node:dev/plugin/templates/std-template/new-object-editor] template.

The @templateOptions@ argument is optional. You can use it to specify custom Handlbars helpers, as in the [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#render] function.

If specifying a @templateOptions@, you can omit the @templateName@ argument entirely to use the implicit name.

As well as the values required by the template, the @view@ may also contain the following keys:

h3(key). pageTitle

Recommended. The title for the page. This is included in the page's @<title>@ tag, and in the heading bar just above the main content of the page.

The value is HTML escaped for safety.


h3(key). layout

Optional. Possible values are:

|@false@|No layout. Use for AJAX responses.|
|@"std:standard"@|The standard layout, including all the normal ONEIS navigation.|
|@null@, @undefined@|Use the @std:standard@ layout.|
|@"std:wide"@|A version of the standard layout, including all the normal ONEIS navigation, with a wider content area.|
|@"std:minimal"@|Minimal layout, using the ONEIS styles and client side resource handling, but without the main navigation.|
|Other string|The name of a template provided by the plugin.|

If the template is not HTML, this property is ignored.

If no layout is specified in the view, the @"std:standard"@ layout is used.

See [node:dev/plugin/request-handling#Layouts] for more information.


h3(key). backLink

Optional. The URL for the optional back link in the top left of the page.


h3(key). backLinkText

Optional. The label for the back link. If @backLink@ if specified and @backLinkText@ is not, then the default text of "Back" is used.


h3(function). renderIntoSidebar(view, templateName, templateOptions)

Render a template, and append the result to the content displayed in the Sidebar.

Similar to @render()@ in usage, but the @templateName@ argument must be provided.


h3(function). appendSidebarHTML(html)

Append the given @html@ to the content displayed in the Sidebar.
