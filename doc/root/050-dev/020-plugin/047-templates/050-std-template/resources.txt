This template always renders as an empty string, but as a side effect, sets CSS and client side JavaScript resources to be included in the generated HTML page.

This only works when you're using the default HTML layout. If you're generating the entire page yourself, you'll have to write your own tags.

This is intended for generated CSS and JavaScript files, not static files. If you want to include files in your @static@ folder, it's much easier to use the [node:dev/plugin/templates/std-template/plugin-static] template, or call the @useStaticResource()@ function on the [node:dev/plugin/interface/response] object.


h2. View

h3(key). javascript

Either a single @String@, or an @Array@ of strings. Each string is the pathname of a JavaScript resource available on this server, and must begin with @/@. A @<script>@ tag will be generated for each pathname.


h3(key). css

As @javascript@, but generates @<link>@ tags to include CSS files.


h2. Example

h3. Template

<pre>
{{>std:resources}}
<h2>A title</h2>
<p> ... </p>
</pre>


h3. Request handler

<pre>language=javascript
P.respond("GET", "/do/example/test", [
], function(E) {
    E.render({
        pageTitle:"Including resources",
        "std:resources": {
            css: "/api/example/generated_css",
            javascript: [
                "/api/example/generated_javascript_one",
                "/api/example/generated_javascript_two"
            ]
        }
    });
});
</pre>

The pathnames of the example files refer to other request handlers for this plugin. They'll send the correct MIME type so the browser knows what to do with the files.
