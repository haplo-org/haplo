Create an editor for a proposed new object in the store based, on a supplied template object. Use this to offer the user an object with pre-filled fields, ready for editing, confirmation, and saving.

The HTML @<form>@ generated will POST the object to a handler provided by the Platform, so there's no need for your plugin to do anything more than display the result of this template.


h2. View

h3(key). templateObject

A template [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object], created with [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/object].

This must contain at least a Type attribute, using the schema [node:dev/plugin/schema/type] constants.


h3(key). successRedirect

Optional. If this key is specified, the user's browser will be redirected to this path after successful creation of the new object.

The path must be a string beginning with '/', and not contain any strange characters. Use URL %-encoding to include other characters.

A parameter for the new object's reference will be appended to the URL. If the ref is @1234-56@, and the URL contains a '?', @"&ref=1234-56"@ will be appended to the URL, otherwise @"?ref=1234-56"@

If this path is not specified, the user will be redirected to the object page.

*NOTE*: Do not rely on this redirect to ensure that important actions are performed, as it depends on the browser making a request. Problems on the client side or in the network could cause this redirect to fail. Use the [node:dev/plugin/hook/post-object-change] hook to observe object creation reliably.
